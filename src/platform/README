This directory contains wrapper (abstraction layer) to OS and radio stack.

SyncAgent is platform independent, if OS and radio stack are abstracted.

Each .cpp file is a stub, so the library compiles cleanly when producing an executable artifact.
(But the executable won't execute.)

A .cpp may also include incomplete implementations by platform, using #ifdefs.
But implementations should be separate and conform to API given by the .h files.

When linking to this project as static library,
the calling project must implement API given by platformAbstractionForSync.h.
You can either copy platformAbstractionForSync.h to the calling project, 
or just insure the calling project implements the API.



Platforms:
- stubs
- PLATFORM_TIRTOS
- PLATFORM_NRF

- FUTURE: wireless network simulator
- FUTURE: PLATFORM_CMSIS (when it has a BT stack?)
- FUTURE:  others: myNewt, mBed, FreeRTOS with Linux BT stack?
