This directory contains abstraction layer to platform's lib and radio stack.
SyncAgent is platform agnostic but requires platform support.

Each .cpp file is a stub, so the library compiles cleanly when producing an executable artifact.
(But the executable won't execute.)

When linking to this project as static library,
the calling project must implement API given by platformAbstractionForSync.h (and nested includes).
Insure the calling project implements the API.


Platforms:
- stubs
- PLATFORM_TIRTOS
- PLATFORM_NRF

- FUTURE: wireless network simulator
- FUTURE: PLATFORM_CMSIS (when it has a BT stack?)
- FUTURE:  others: myNewt, mBed, FreeRTOS with Linux BT stack?
