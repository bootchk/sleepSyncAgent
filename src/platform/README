This directory contains wrapper (abstraction layer) to OS and radio stack.

The idea is that SyncAgent is platform independent, if OS and radio stack are abstracted.

Each .cpp file includes stubs, and implementations by platform, using #ifdefs.

To compile for a platform, #define the platform. 

Stubs give a clean compile, but won't execute.

Platforms:
- stubs
- PLATFORM_TIRTOS

- FUTURE: wireless network simulator
- FUTURE: PLATFORM_CMSIS (when it has a BT stack?)
- FUTURE:  others: myNewt, mBed, FreeRTOS with Linux BT stack?
