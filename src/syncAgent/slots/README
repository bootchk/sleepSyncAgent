There is no Slot superclass.

The public API is just perform().

Most slots use the globals.

Most slots do start(), dispatchUntil(), stop() where start() and stop() setup the Radio.

Most slots listen and/or send.

Ordering of slots is known by SyncAgent.loop()

Timing of the slots is known by Schedule.

Some slots change the Schedule and Role owned by SyncAgent.
