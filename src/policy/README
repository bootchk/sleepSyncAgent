Files here concern policy: behaviour of algorithm.

Policy is informal meta class, not a superclass.

Policy instances owned by some slots, and some other objects (Clique.)

- dropping out: assuming mastership of clique when master not heard for a long time

- master sync xmitting: how and how often a master xmits to avoid contention and yet prevent dropouts

- merge sync xmitting: how and how often a unit xmits MergeSync to merge fished cliques
